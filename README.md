## Description
_Wise Commute allows Trimet commuters a platform to make better commuting decisions based off train statistics. As a user you can find out in real time what the train capacity, train car length, and train arrival times are for your desired train. Leveraging the real time data provided by Trimet's API, we were able to separate ourselves from other commuter apps._
